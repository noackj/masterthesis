  abstract = {Previous studies of engineering change management (ECM) presented valuable results from the design domain of the product lifecycle management (PLM) perspective. However, few of these studies proposed a framework under the configuration management II (CMII) standards and its industrial implementation based on the design and manufacturing domains of PLM and enterprise resources planning. This study proposes an advanced CMII-based ECM framework. This framework has been successfully implemented in a large Taiwanese motorcycle manufacturer resulting in significant performance improvement. Major contributions of this study include: (1) presenting an advanced CMII-based ECM framework, (2) depicting information exchange and integration between the design and manufacturing activities based on five major ECM phases and their associated processes and (3) providing a basis for best practice from the motorcycle industry for reference in other manufacturing industries.
